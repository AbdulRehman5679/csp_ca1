    <h1>Euro</h1>
    <p>
        The <Strong>euro</Strong>(symbol: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of 19 of the 27 member states of the
        European Union. This group of states is known as the eurozone or, officially, the euro area, and includes about
        343 million citizens as of 2019.<sup>[11][12]</sup> The euro, which is divided into 100 cents, is the
        second-largest and second-most traded currency in the international markets for the related different types of transactions after
        the United States dollar.<sup>[13]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        The currency is also used officially by the institutions of the European Union, by four European microstates
        that are not EU members,<sup>[12]</sup> the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, as well as
        unilaterally by Montenegro and Kosovo. Outside Europe, a number of special territories of EU members also use the euro as their
        currency. Additionally, over 200 million people worldwide use currencies pegged to the euro.
    </p>
    <p>
        The euro is the second-largest reserve currency as well as the second-most traded currency in the world after
        the United States dollar.<sup>[14][15][16]</sup> As of December 2019, with more than €1.3 trillion in
        circulation, the euro has one of the highest combined values of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world.<sup>[17][18]</sup>

    </p>
    <p>
        The name euro was officially adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid.<sup>[19]</sup> The euro was introduced to
        world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former European Currency Unit (ECU)
        at a ratio of 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002,
        making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by March 2002 it had completely
        replaced the former currencies.<sup>[20]</sup> While the euro dropped to US$0.83 within two years (26 October
        2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.60 on 18 July 2008 and since then returning
        near to its original issue rate. In late 2009, the euro became immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis,
        which led to the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at
        stabilising and strengthening the currency.
    </p>
    <h2>Administration</h2>
    <p>
        The euro is managed and administered by the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem
        (composed of the central banks of the eurozone countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole
        authority to set monetary policy. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of notes
        and coins in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and
        budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. Denmark has negotiated
        exemptions,<sup>[21]</sup> while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a
        non-binding referendum in 2003, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the
        monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the
        euro in due course. The Maastricht Treaty was later amended by the Treaty of Nice,<sup>[22]</sup> which closed
        the gaps and loopholes in the Maastricht and Rome Treaties.
    </p>
    <h3>Issuing modalitites for banknotes</h3>
    <p>
        Since 1 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint
        basis.<sup>[23]</sup> Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other
        Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the
        Eurosystem.<sup>[23]</sup> In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby
        incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the
        ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB
        capital key,<sup>[23]</sup> calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share
        of EU GDP, equally weighted.<sup>[24]</sup>
    </p>
    <h4>Characteristics(Coins and banknotes)</h4>
    <p>
        The euro is divided into 100 cents (also referred to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from
        other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts
        the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, notwithstanding normal English
        usage.<sup>[25][26]</sup> Otherwise, normal English plurals are used,<sup>[27]</sup> with many local variations such as centime in France.
